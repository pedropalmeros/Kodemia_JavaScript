            <h2> Function</h2>
            <p>A funciton is a block of JavaScript code that is defined once gbut may be executed, or invoked, any number of times.
                JavaScript functions are parametrized: a funciton definition may include a list of identifiers, known as parameters,
                that work as local variables for the body function. 
            </p>

            <p>Functions often use their argument values to copute a reuturn value that  become the value
                 of the function-invocation expression.
            </p>

            <p>If a function is assigned to a property of an object, it is known as a method of that object. When a function is invoked
                on or through an object, that object is the incation context or <samp>this</samp>(like c++???) value for the function.
               Functions designed to initalize a newly created object al called constructors. 
            </p>

            <p>Functions ar objects, and the can be manipulated by programs. JavaScript can assign functios to variables and pass them to other functions.

            <h2> Defining functions</h2>
            In order to define a function 
            <ol>
                <li>Using the reserved word <samp>function</samp></li>
                <li>Indentifier or function name</li>
                <li>The list of parameters between parenthesis</li>
                <li>The block of code</li>
                <li>Optional the Return function</li> 
            </ol>

            <h2> Function Expressions</h2>
            Function expressions look like function declarations, but they apear within the context of
            a larger expressions or statement, and the name is optional

            <div class="genericCode">
                <div class="genericImages__container">
                    <img src="./Img/fnc_03.png" class="genericImage_Image" alt="first function example">
                    <div class="genericImages__footer">
                        <p>These codes are simmilar, the main difference is the Function Expression</p> 
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            The Function Expressions are usefull when trying to implement some kind of recursion
            <div class="genericCode">
                <div class="genericImages__container">
                    <img src="./Img/fnc_04.png" class="genericImage_Image" alt="first function example">
                    <div class="genericImages__footer">
                        <p>Function called from itself</p> 
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>A function declaraton actually declares a variabel and assigns a function object to it. A Function
            expression, on the other hand, does not declare a variable: it is up to you to assign the newly defined
            function object to a constant or variable if you are going to need to refer to it multiple times. It
            is a good practice to use <samp>const</samp> with function espressions so you don't accidentally 
            overwrite your functions by assigning new values. </p>

            <p>When you use the declaration form, the function objects are created before the code that contains them starts
                to run, and the definitions are hoisted so that you can call these functions from code that appears above 
                the definition statement. This iis not true for functios defined as expressions, however: these functions
                do not exists until the expression that defines them are actually evaluated. Furthermore, in order to invoke
                a function, you must be able to refer to it, and you can't refer to a function defined as an expression until
                it is assigned to a variable, so functions defined with expressions cannot be invoked before they are defined
